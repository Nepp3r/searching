Searching corrupted URL

Some utility, that was created for finding corrupted links onto some depth.
You can enter the link and the level upon which program will search for currupted links.
This program works with the BFS algorithm, athough it can be done better with DFS algorithm, but if you don't really afraid of a little lower speed, use it as you want.
If anyone would be interested of using my code in your own project, I would be grateful.
